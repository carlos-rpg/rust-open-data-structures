# OPEN DATA STRUCTURES IN RUST
An implementation in Rust of the data structures in the free book 
[Open Data Structures](https://www.opendatastructures.org/) (edition 0.1Gβ) by 
Pat Morin. Thanks to the author for making this knowledge accessible to 
everybody.

The goal is to give Rust learners didactic implementations in order to learn 
both the language and the data structures.

The book can be read in different versions that differ in the implementation 
language (Pseudocode, C++, Java and Python at the time of writing this). This 
repo implement the data structures featured in the pseudocode version.

## What you will find here
Straightforward implementations of the book's contents, leveraging 
the tools offered by Rust's standard library. Unit tests and trait 
implementations included.

You won't find an optimized, production ready library that may 
sacrifice clarity for performance.
